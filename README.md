# SQL-Data-Cleaning

We are faced with data that is inconsistent, incomplete, and noisy when there are a lot of data. We work very hard to extract precise and good insights from data since we are data enthusiasts. In order to do that, we must first fix the data cleaning issue. Data cleansing tasks took up the majority of the work of the data scientists and data analysts. In this case, I used MySQL to clean up some data. can aid in increasing one's familiarity with SQL.
The tasks we perform for data cleaning include:
1. To identify the shape of the data
2. Explore the data to get familar with the data
3. Convert Sales date into Standard sales date format
4. Identify Missing propert address
5.  Delete Missing Values in the table
6. Breaking address into individual column (Address, City, State)
7. Replace the data of sale as vacant feature
8. Check for duplicate values
9. Delete Duplicate data from the table
10. Drop Unsual columns
